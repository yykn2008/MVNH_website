      Kingfishers can be seen along the length of the river â€“ a flash of blue and
      orange flying swiftly past. Grey wagtails are also common often seen around
      the Leatherhead Town Bridge and in Winter goosanders can be seen swimming
      along the river.

    <p>
      There is a range of birds found in our farmland habitat including game birds
      such as pheasants and red-legged partridge. In the hedgerows you can see
      yellowhammers and finches and feeding in the fields there are often skylarks
      and thrushes; in the Winter the song and mistle thrushes are joined by
      redwings and fieldfares from Scandinavia.

      Our commons and heathlands are home all year round to birds such as finches
      and tits. Rarer summer migrants include woodlarks (Headley Heath),
      nightingales and warblers (Bookham Common). Arguably the most important
      bird site in Mole Valley is Bookham Common for nightingales.
